As said by Kevin Alexander Leon who is a United States Politician: \u201cRecycling more plastics can help local businesses and expand jobs while supporting the goals of sustainability.\u201d Households in Accra, Ghana generate all kinds of waste including food waste, plastic, paper, and metals among others. Plastic bottle waste constitutes 29% of waste per household. In addition, most (62%) households dispose of waste weekly with few (6%) doing the same monthly. On average, households spend $2 per week which sums up to $8 per month to dispose of waste. This is significant on household income because about 27,231 people live below the extreme poverty line of $129/year and 304,989 people live below the poverty incident of $211 of Accra\u2019s population (5,446,237) according to the Ghana Living Standard Survey, 2017. Therefore, an incentive to earn from plastic waste would impact hugely on household income thus, allowing individual households to earn from the plastic waste they generate in Accra, Ghana. Our market survey indicates that most plastic recycling companies in Accra and Ghana at large have indicated their dissatisfaction with how households handle plastic waste. Only a few (5.9%) of households practice waste separation. Research has also shown that households & institutions in Accra have indicated their plight in the high cost of traveling to recycling firms in order of waste disposal and lack of education as well as bins for practicing waste separation. Cardano Care Dapp would mitigate transport costs and provide separate bins for storing plastic bottle waste to enable the collection of plastic bottle waste in Ghana. About 94.1% of households are willing to segregate their waste and every household (100%) are willing to drop off plastic bottle waste for a cash incentive.
