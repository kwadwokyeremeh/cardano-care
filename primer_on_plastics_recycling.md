# A Primer on Plastic Recycling

The process of recovering waste or scrap plastic and reprocessing the materials into functional and useful products is referred to as plastic recycling.

As said by Kevin Alexander Leon who is a United States Politician: _“Recycling more plastics can help local businesses and expand jobs while supporting the goals of sustainability.”_

Households in Kumasi, Ghana generate all kinds of waste including food waste, plastic, paper, and metals among others. Plastic bottle waste constitutes **29%** of waste per household.

In addition, most (**62%**) households dispose of waste weekly with few (**6%**) doing the same monthly. On average, households spend **$2** per week which sums up to **$8** per month to dispose of waste.

This is significant on household income because about **27,231** people live below the extreme poverty line of **$129/year** and **304,989** people live below the poverty incident of **$211** of Kumasi’s population (**5,446,237**) according to the Ghana Living Standard Survey, **2017**.

Therefore, an incentive to earn from plastic waste would impact hugely on household income thus, allowing individual households to earn from the plastic waste they generate in Kumasi, Ghana.

Our market survey indicates that most plastic recycling companies in Kumasi and Ghana at large have indicated their dissatisfaction with how households handle plastic waste. Only a few (**5.9%**) of households practice waste separation.

Research has also shown that households & institutions in Kumasi have indicated their plight in the high cost of traveling to recycling firms in order of waste disposal and lack of education as well as bins for practicing waste separation.

Cardano Recycling Dapp would mitigate transport costs and provide separate bins for storing plastic bottle waste to enable the collection of plastic bottle waste in Ghana. About **94.1%** of households are willing to segregate their waste and every household (**100%**) are willing to drop off plastic bottle waste for a cash incentive.
