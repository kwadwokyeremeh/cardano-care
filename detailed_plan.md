## Detailed Plan

Cardano Recycling Dapp is a decentralized plastic waste trading platform and marketplace that will be built on the Cardano blockchain. 

It will allow households & institutions to find a suitable plastic recycling company to trade their plastic waste in a timely and cost-effective manner. 

The marketplace will enable plastic recyclers to focus on the recycling process without having to engage in often questionable business-boosting practices; plastic wastes will flow to plastic recyclers for a small percentage of their recycling fee.
