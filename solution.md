## Solution

Our solution is to create an appropriate platform (progressive web application) where institutions (government and private) will connect their generated recyclable plastic waste directly to recycling agencies for incentivization without any third parties who usually pick up this waste free of charge.

Since the problem we are looking to solve is a global problem, our solution is also going to be for global use. However, the pilot program will be launched in Ghana, specifically in Kumasi.
