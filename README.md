Cardano Recycling DApp seeks to establish a platform that would encourage waste separation from various sources of waste generation, including institutions (private and government) and recycling agencies. The proposal addresses this challenge by way of providing rewards and incentives to stakeholders (households, private and government institutions, and recycling agencies) in the recycling sector using the DApp and smart contracts.

Again, the creation of the DApp does not only provide business solutions but also removes middlemen and directly connects households, private, and government institutions to recycling agencies. The smart contract establishes a relationship that enables households, private and government institutions to separate waste from its source as consumers, and the DApp creates an avenue to exchange plastic waste for incentive. The recycling agencies would, through the DApp, engage in direct pick-up. That would save time and cost in plastic waste collection and waste recovery. Hence, reducing production costs and allowing for the smooth operation of recycling processes.

Directly and indirectly, this proposal would create employment and increase the income of stakeholders involved in the recycling value chain.



Our long-term vision is to extend the usage of this platform from just institutions to households through the creation of a mobile application. With a successful mobile application, it can be guaranteed that the solution will be adopted globally as mobile applications are less difficult to operate and a large percentage of the total population can afford a mobile phone. After successful onboarding, it can then be assured that 98% of recyclable plastic waste generated across the world will end up in the recycling hubs for recycling purposes.



Local/Global Impact?

This platform is estimated to have three (3) main impacts on the local/global community;

Recycling Agencies: According to research, plastic recycling agencies incur extra costs and time in performing waste segregation and cleansing. Wastes generated in institutions are usually not segregated and thus appear in mixed variants like medical waste, food waste, plastic waste, metal waste, etc., all mixed together. This practice leaves the recyclable plastics among the waste vulnerable and exposed to dirt.



For recycling activities, the plastic waste that is dirty must be cleansed before continuing with the further process of turning it into PET. This policy implies that recycling agencies who come across such recyclable plastics must incur extra time and cost in ensuring cleansing, and this causes delays in the workflow.



Through our initiative, waste segregation bins meant only for recyclable plastic waste will be distributed to institutions in addition to education on why they need to practice waste segregation from their point. 



The impact of this is to cut the extra cost and time that usually needs to be incurred by recycling agencies and boost the workflow as theyâ€™re able to focus on recycling and not segregation, which would be done by institutions.



Institutions: Locally, institutions, which are a good source of recyclable plastic waste, do not get any value from the recyclable plastic waste they generate in their environs. Yet, they pay waste collection agencies for the collection of their waste. This compiled waste is usually a mixture of food waste, metal waste, plastic waste, paper waste, etc. 



This is due to the fact that most institutions do not know the value of recyclable plastic waste, the benefits of recycling, and the means for practising waste segregation.



Through our initiative, through the workshop, the various institutions that sign up for the pilot program will be educated on why it is important to practice waste segregation at their point, what the value of recyclable plastic waste is, and lastly, they will be presented with waste segregation bins specifically for recyclable plastic waste collection.



The impact of this is to ensure that recyclable plastic waste is now seen to be valuable by institutions, and through the incentivization, another revenue gate is opened to them.



Environment: What would happen to the external environment of institutions if all their plastic waste was kept within? The answer is, the external environment would almost be free from plastic waste pollution. 



We believe in this theory because our initiative seeks to empower institutions to encourage all employees and customers to dispose of their used recyclable plastic into the recyclable plastic segregation bin. By doing so, no recyclable plastic waste gets the chance to end up in the oceans and/or on the streets, thus satisfying SDG 1, 12, 13, and 14.
